# blockjournal-poc

Proof of concept for blockjournal. This project runs locally only.

### Requirements:

- node v16n
- npm 8
- metamask installed

### Setup:

- run npm i in each folder
- Add infura api key and secret to backend/.env

#### To start, run these commands in their own terminals:

- npm run start:blockchain
- npm run start:backend
- (wait 5 seconds for blockchain to load and deploy)
- npm run start:frontend

Note that the deploy script in smart-contracts also copies contract address and abi to frontend (that's why you have to wait 5 seconds).

### Setup metamask:

- switch metamask to local host network 8545
- import the following private key to metamask:

        0xdf57089febbacf7ba0bc227dafbffa9fc08a93fdc68e1e42411a14efcf23656e

  (This is a test account generated by the hardhat node local network. Do NOT send any ethererum or any currency to it!)

- you should now be able to interact with the locally deployed contract and server via the frontend.

### Debugging:

Most errors will appear in the one of the 3 terminals you have open or also in the browser console.
It is quite common to get Metamask errors about "already in queue" or "Nonce to high". This happens quite frequently - in this case you need to reset Metamask. This is done by:

- Open metamask
- Click your account circle (top right)
- click Settings
- click Advanced
- scroll down to the big red RESET button and click it.

### Tests:

At the moment there are only tests for the smart contracts. To run these:

- navigate to /smart-contracts
- run

        npx hardhat test
