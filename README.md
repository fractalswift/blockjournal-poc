# blockjournal-poc

To start, run these commands in their own terminals:

- npm run start:blockchain
- npm run start:backend
- npm run start:frontend

Note that the deploy script in smart-contracts also copies contract address and abi to frontend.

- switch metamask to local host network

- you should now be able to interact with the locally deployed contract and server via the frontend.
